Appddiction Studio Project Management Approach

**Standard Approach**

For large projects, encompassing large enterprise initiatives Appddiction
Studio, being a Scaled Agile Gold Partner, has adopted the Scaled Agile
Framework as the framework of choice for large Agile projects. On large projects
we are performing on we have anywhere from 4 – 12 Agile Scrum teams working as
part of an Agile Release Train (ART). Those teams are almost always Feature
teams, or teams capable of delivering entire Features without requiring
assistance or expertise from external teams. The standard personnel make up of
these Agile Scrum Feature teams is a count between 5 – 9 members. Within that
count are developers, testers. Each team is assigned a Product Owner, a Scrum
Master. In addition, each team has access to a System Architect, and in some
cases, Solution Architects or even an Enterprise Architect. Usually, Security
personnel, UI/UX designers, and DevOps personnel will server multiple teams and
work as a shared service within the ART.

**Approach Adapted for Coding Challenge**

For this challenge, we took that approach and scaled down to demonstrate the
process in a condensed time period. For our 10-day Program Increment we chose to
have five two-day iterations with stand-ups occurring every 4 hours (two
standups per day). The team was comprised of 4 developers, with 1 scrum master
also taking the role of Product Owner. Additionally, 1 Solution Architect was
also part of the team taking the additional roles of System Team, and Security
Team.
